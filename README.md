# Coupon Analysis Findings

In this analysis the coupon data was examined using pandas, plotly and seaborn.
Data was cleaned and categorized for easier examination. 
Besides data exploration, two specific coupons and their acceptance rate were examined in detail: Bar Coupons and Expensive Restaurant Coupons.

Below are some findings about the Bar Coupons:

Drivers with the following characteristics are  of acceptance rate for bar coupons lie within these characteristics:
 - Drivers aged 25 - 30
 - Drivers who don't have children in the car as passengers
 - Drivers who make over 50k
 - Drivers not working in farming, fishing, forestry industries

 I would use this criteria to target my marketing better for bar coupons towrd the higher-acceptance driver groups

 Below are some findings about the Expensive Restaurant Coupons:

Based on the analysis, my recommendation for the marketing team is to provide more of the expensive restaurant coupons to our successful target group 2f, which represents people who go to expensive restaurants 4+ times per week, make $100k+, are under 50 years old and are male. The acceptance rate for this Group 2f is 67% vs. for those who are not in this group 44%. Conversion of this coupon will be much more successful in this specific group based on my findings above.
